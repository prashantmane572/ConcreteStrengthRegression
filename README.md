Concrete is one of the most important materials in Civil Engineering. Knowing the compressive strength of concrete is very important when constructing a building or a bridge. The Compressive Strength of Concrete is a highly nonlinear function of ingredients used in making it and their characteristics. Thus, using Machine Learning to predict the Strength could be useful in generating a combination of ingredients which result in high Strength.



## Problem Statement
Predicting Compressive Strength of Concrete given its age and quantitative measurements of ingredients.
